Nan Lin is Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Washington University in St. Louis and has a joint appointment in the Division of Biostatistics, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine. His methodological research is in the areas of big data, quantile regression, bioinformatics, Bayesian statistics, longitudinal and functional data analysis. His applied research involves statistical analysis of data from anesthesiology and genomics. He teaches a wide range of statistics courses, including mathematical statistics, Bayesian statistics, linear models, experimental design, statistical computation, and nonparametric statistics.

He earned a B.S. (1999) from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://ustc.edu.cn/), a M.S. (2000) and Ph.D. (2003) in [Statistics](https://stat.illinois.edu/), and a second M.S. (2003) in [Finance](https://giesbusiness.illinois.edu/finance) from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). Before joining Washington University, he was a postdoctoral associate (2003-2004) at the [Center for Statistical Genomics and Proteomics](http://zhaocenter.org/), [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/).
